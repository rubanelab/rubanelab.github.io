### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI, that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programed. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data.
- Automatically learn
- Improve performance from past experience
- Make predictions

### Types of Machine Learning
Based on the methods and way of learning, majorly divided into following categories,
- Supervised learning (labeled data - some of the data already mapped with the output)
	* Classifification - spam detection, fraud detection, churn analysis, disease prediction
	  KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayse, 
	* Regression - another type of supervised learning. there is a relationship between input and output, and based on that you use to predict the continuous out variable.

	* Forecasting (date time plays vital role)
- Unsupervised learning (news -> sports, politics, cinema, if new news comes should predict)
- Reinforcement learning


Diving the data into a proper training and test data is very important. Sometimes your predictions may go wrong.
Draw a line that should closest to all data points (best fit line).
