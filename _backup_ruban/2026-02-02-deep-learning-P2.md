### Backward Propagation & Forward Propagation
In deep learning, forward propagation and backward propagation are the two core phases that allow neural networks to learn from data.

**Full Training Cycle**

- Forward propagation → Get prediction
- Compute loss → Measure error
- Backward propagation → Compute gradients
- Update weights → Improve model

Repeat thousands of times → Model learns patterns.

- Forward Propagation = Makes predictions
- Backward Propagation = Learns from mistakes
